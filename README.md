## Usage Instructions

Once you have installed the Leonardo Blender Plugin, follow these instructions to generate textures for your 3D models:

1. Before generating a texture, you need to upload a mesh from the **Mesh Settings** section.
2. If you have previously uploaded a mesh, you can find a list of your meshes in the same section. Select the one you want to work with.
3. To preview the texture from one side of the model, explore the options in the **Preview** section.
4. To generate a texture, follow these steps:
   - Select an uploaded mesh.
   - Enter a prompt and an optional negative prompt.
   - Press the "Texturize!" button.
5. The algorithm requires knowledge of the front of the mesh, so make sure you align your mesh with one of the principal axes and select it in the settings.

With these instructions, you can now seamlessly create stunning textures for your 3D models using the Leonardo Blender Plugin.
